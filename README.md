# Film-Map
Film-Map is a set of Python functions which help a user to generate an HTML map with 10 locations around the user's place on the globe, where movies were filmed.
## Installation
To generate your own map, install the code and all the files via GitHub and run it on your computer.
## Usage
To generate a map, first enter the year you would like to have a map for, then - your latitude and longitude (format: lat, lon), and press Enter.

While the map is being generated, you'll see the corresponding message:
![Generating a map](screen2.png?raw=true"text")
When the map is ready, you'll be informed about it and invited to have a look at an HTML-file, which you can open in your browser by clicking twice on a generated file (filmmap.html in the example).
![Map saved as filmmap.html](screen3.png?raw=true"text")
Your map includes three layers - you can switch them on and off via the layer control panel in the right upper corner of the map. To see what each layer is responsible for, choose a layer and click on an icon - you'll see either a movie title or a distance to the location it was filmed at.
