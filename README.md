# Film-Map
Film-Map is a set of Python functions which help a user to generate an HTML map with 10 locations around the user's place on the globe, where movies were filmed.
# Installation
To generate your own map, install the code and a .list file with locations via GitHub and run it on your computer.
# Usage
To generate a map, first enter the year you would like to have a map for, then - your latitude and longitude (format: lat, lon), and press Enter.
While the map is being generated, you'll see the corresponding message:
When the map is ready, you'll be informed about it and invited to have a look at an HTML-file, which you can open in your browser by clicking twice on a generated file (filmmap.html in the example).
Your map includes three layers - you can switch them on and off via the layer control panel in the right upper corner of the map.
